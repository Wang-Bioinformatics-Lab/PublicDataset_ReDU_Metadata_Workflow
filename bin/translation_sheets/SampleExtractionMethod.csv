"Following lysis and standard addition, protein precipitation was performed by adding 800µL of ice-cold methanol (4x by volume). Samples were incubated at -80°C overnight. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to eliminate proteins. The supernatants containing metabolites were dried via speed-vacuum.",methanol (100%)
"For LCMS analysis lyophilized fecal sample was extracted with 80% Methanol containg 18 µg/ml of umbelliferon, sonicated and vortexed 20 seconds each, shaken at 140 rpmfor 2 h. For GCMS-polar analysis samples were extracted with water, containing 25 ?g/ml ribitol, vortex for 20 seconds, sonicated for 20 seconds, incubated at 50C for 1h.

"Ground tissue powder was kept in liquid nitrogen between homogenization and The extraction solvent was prepared by mixing isopropanol/ acetonitrile/water the volume ratio 3:3:2 and degassing this mixture by directing a gentle stream nitrogen through the solvent for 5 min. The solvent was cooled to )20 C prior extraction. Randomly processing all samples of the study, 1 ml of cold solvent 20 mg of ground tissue was added, vortexed for 10 sec, and shaken at 4 C for 5 to extract metabolites and simultaneously precipitate proteins. After at 12 800 g for 2 min, 90% of the supernatant was removed, taking are not to any residues from the pellet",acetonitrile-isopropanol-water (3:3:2)
